    <h2>How to cook bakwan sayur (Indonesian vegetable fritters) at home</h2>

        <p>
            Bakwan sayur is Indonesia deep fried vegetables fritters. Found nation
            wide, mostly sold by street food vendors, the most popular version uses 
            a mix of cabbage, carrot, and mung bean sprouts. Some regions in Indonesia 
            call this as bala-bala, though it is more widely known as bakwan.

        <h3>You cannot avoid deep frying</h3>
        <p>
            If you want to whip up authentic bakwan, there is no avoiding deep 
            frying. To get crispy bakwan, my trick is to make sure the oil is hot, 
            and the bakwan batter is super cold. If you have a thermometer, you want 
            the oil to reach 170&#8451; (340&#8457;). If you don't have a thermometer, 
            the oil should look shimmering, and a drop of batter should sink slightly 
            in the hot oil and immediately float up the surface. 
            To make sure the batter is cold, use ice cold water. Usually, I even 
            put the batter back in the friedge while my pot of oil is heating up. 
            Once out from the hot oil, drain the bakwan over a wire rack to remove
            excess oil. Please don't drain excess oil with paper towels as they will 
            make the fritters soggy. Serve the fritters immediately, or with your 
            favorite chili sauce.

            <p>Instructions</p>
            <ol>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, combine all purpose flour, 
                    rice flour, salt, sugar, and ground pepper. Add water 
                    and mix well, make sure there are no lumps.</li>
                <li>Add grated garlic and egg into the batter. Mix well.</li>
                <li>Add shredded blanched cauliflower/cabbage, shredded 
                    carrot, and sliced scallions into the batter and mix well.</li>
                <li>Put the bakwan batter in the fridge while we heat up the 
                    oil to keep the batter as cold as possible.</li>
                <li>Pour enough oil in a pot for deep frying. Once a bit of 
                    batter dropped into the oil bubbles immediately, the oil 
                    is ready. If you have a thermometer, wait until the oil 
                    reaches 170&#8451; (340&#8457;).</li>
                <li>Remove bakwan batter from the fridge. Use a small laddle 
                    (or ice cream scoop) and drop a laddleful of vegetables 
                    mixture into the hot oil. Deep fry until the fritter is 
                    crispy and turns golden brown on both sides, remove and 
                    drain on a wire rack/paper towel. Repeat until all batter 
                    is used up.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately with some Thai chilies, or a combination 
                    of tomato sauce and chili sauce.</li>

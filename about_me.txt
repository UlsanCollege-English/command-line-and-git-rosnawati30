My name is Rosnawati. I am 20 years old. I am currently in my third year.
I am pursuing my degree in informatics engineering at Politeknik Negeri Jakarta.
As an informatics engineering student, I learn many things about IT.
My goal is to become a web developer, specifically a front-end developer.
To reach my goal, I already have experience making a website that can run on
local host or prototype. Thus, I believe I can reach my goal in the near future.

However, now I'm at Ulsan College and am currently in my first semester.
The degree I take at Ulsan College is similar to my original degree at my home university, which is Global ICT.
Additionally, I just studied for one semester at Ulsan College.
